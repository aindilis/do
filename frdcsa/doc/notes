Here is what I would do.

I would make the PlanFormalizationAndReification subsystem trivial, in
that  it  just   maps  goals  to  states  with   obscure  CycIDs  like
"ES-State-1002314", but it asserts complex relationships between them,
that are derived  from Cyc.  There are temporal  semantics that can be
associated  with states,  and  these  are the  first  arena of  actual
extraction.  Gate may be  used for temporal expression identification?

Next I would have an event system monitor, which consists of triggers,
i.e. assertions that  are made if certain events  occur (and I suppose
can be repealed).

For the  plan system, it tries  to develop plans  that satisfy certain
states, which  for now simply  have a preference relation.   There are
also equivalence classes which dictate replanning behaviour.

States  simply consist  of queries,  which can  be true  or  false (or
unknown)

It  may  be   difficult  to  generate  a  temporal   plan  from  these
constraints.

The next part is the  plan executor.  It feeds accomplishments through
the event system.  If after an action a task is completed or a certain
desireable state is obtained, a positive score is added to the system.
