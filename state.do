(goal (make the entire goal system printed out))

(get end to end .do <-> .pddl translation going)

(map out all the goals in the entire system this way)

(develop a plan of what needs to be done)

(we want to get the system working)

(we need the Formalize code working)

(in order to get more work done, need more developers)

(one way to get more developers is to release the FRDCSA)

(find parts of other statements using inference - for instance -
 anything that entails "release the FRDCSA" as any legitimate part
 of a sentence)

(have the cause effect system working)

(where is the do to pddl translator)

(need to process everything, preferably on workhorse, however, that's not absolutely necessary)

(in order to get workhorse working, need to finish FRDCSA
 installer or just do it manually)

(could practice the development of the installer on the VM host -
 would actually make more sense to do it that way, maybe)

(the installer requires the same technology - basically the .do
 <-> .pddl system working)

(make sure all the project indexes are built - keep a list of
 them)

(get systems up and running with Tests)

(invite developers to join us)
