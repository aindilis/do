Here is my plan for the remainder of today.  Quit doing this stupid
manager  stuff.  I mean,  we need  to get  it down  so that  tasks are
getting knocked off somehow, and that that is being recorded by score
or something.

It is  irrelevant that there are better  ways to do this.   We need to
get this done so that we can find those better ways.

That is  the key.  Right now we  have nothing to visualize  and so are
wasting our time getting ahead of ourselves.  I hate visualization.

Some files should  be kind of denied access by  the system (to prevent
the user from working on  things we've decided against.  For instance,
I  shouldn't be  doing any  plotting.   Eventually we  would like  the
system to  know that closely what we  are working on.  We  can do that
with intelligent IDE/language tools)

Here is a general chart of what needs to be done.

Take Spark, and create the basis of the action approval system.

Write code for integrating tasks in two ways -

	1 -	expanding on tasks of interest by either searching the DB
		or eliciting the user to assert new tasks

	2 -	ensuring that all tasks that have been issued before eventually get integrated

By the  end of the  day, we would  like a basic schedule  of important
tasks, and have that integrated with the task probability distribution
by mapping tasks
