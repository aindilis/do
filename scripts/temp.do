(eventually have a KBS2::ImportExport2 that uses that ontology of
 types I developed)

(lookup ebay listing services)

(take some stuff to such a lister
 (old camera (clear out the contents, of course) - do we need a special cord?)
 )

(use cell phone internet to get this done)





(Trying to raise money to get internet to continue job-search -
 want to go through garage and bought stickers to label items for
 sale or not - Mom doesn't want to because it is too hot and "it
would cost a fortune" to circulate cool air from the house to
 cool off the enclosed garage for the time it takes to label the
 items)

(synchronize projects and add a data dir to them - also move them
 to frdcsa???)

(set up a total search system)
