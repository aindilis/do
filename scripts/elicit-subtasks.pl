my @tasks =
  [
   "epoxy the remaining wheels",
  ];

# now this task has some prerequisites

# this is epoxy#v#1, so it becomes:

# "glue with epoxy the remaining wheels"

# now since we have with epoxy, that is a requirement of the task,
# having that

# so at this point it queries the inventory management system for
# epoxy, and finding none, adds a task to purchase some, hopefully
# with a source found on the internet for local pickup


# (have the standard actions library
#  (as in (sell the car) -> (put pictures up), etc)
#  )
